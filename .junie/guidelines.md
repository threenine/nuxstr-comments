## 1. Organize Project Structure

* Follow a domain-driven or feature-based structure rather than organizing by technical layers
* Keep related functionality together to improve code discoverability
* Use a consistent naming convention for packages and files

## 2. Effective Testing

* Write unit tests for business logic
* create mock objects for external dependencies
* Implement integration tests for critical paths and edge cases
